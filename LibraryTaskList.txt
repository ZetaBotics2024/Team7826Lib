        e. Impliment SwerveDriveSubsystem.(Done)
        f. Impliment SwerveModuleIOTalonFX and tripple check it to be correct(Done)
        g. Impliment DriveCommands and add them to Robot Container. (Done)
        h. Figure out why desired module states and actuale module states are the same in the logger.(Done)
        i. Add an PID tuning tool that makes use of advantage scope.(Done)
        j. Add a gyro sim.(done)
        k. Add the PID tuning tool to SwerveModuleIOSparkMax and TalonFX(Done)
        L. Fully test both swerve moduels with motoros I have. 
E. Set up Auton System
    a. Set up system to take in commands and run them during Auton(or for auto positining in teleop)(Also add logging)
        b. Provide an example of an auto rotune in commands using the state based system. 
        c. Make the system take in custem automaticly mirroded pose2d that can take in fudge factors for the position for each allience sepretly.(Done)
    b. Set up a go to Pose with PIDS in a way that makes it work pretter than last years(Rename and refactor)
        a. Create GoToPoseAfterTime(Or something of the same function)(Done)
        b. Create all types of GoToPose that we used last year.(Done)
        c. Create a GoToPose high tolorence and low tolorence(Maybe)
    c. Set up extracted auton system that lets you slot in PathPlanener auton, WPILib Trejectors and Choreo trejectories.(Done)
    D. Add system to auto mirrer pathplanner and choreo autots
F. Set up Odometry Vision
    a. Refactor Vision code to work with Advantage Kit and run on a second thread
    b. Refactor Vision code to be easaly modifable and work with any amount of cameras.
    c. Inigrate vision with Swerve as needed
G. Set up Game Object Tracking
    a. Create Game Object Tracking code for Photon Vision(own thread?) and test it
    b. If it works works good enough set up a system to move to a game object based on the location read by the camera and make it in a way that is easy to use with auton
    c. If posible make it so that it live tracks the game object and goes to ware it is in relation to the robot every frame 
        rather than based on a one time read inital value that the robot reads
H. Make swerve drive speed profiler(Done)
I. Add a seperation between simulation and real modes for needed constants.(Done)
G. Add all log basses to logger constants.
